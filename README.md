# App-for-Shopify
Jose Pulido, Shopify Partner - App Example Integration
Using Node.js, React, and GraphQL. 

Apollo
To create a React component that conveniently handles all your operations with Shopify’s API.

Polaris
Using Polaris components helps your app look and feel native to Shopify, so it’s easier to use for merchants.

GraphQL
Most of Shopify already runs on GraphQL and we believe the learning curve will be worth the investment for developers.
